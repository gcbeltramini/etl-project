# Analyze the data

Use [`psql` directly](postgresql.md#check-schemas-and-tables-run-queries) or use the new `conda`
environment in jupyter notebook.

Run all scripts below from the project folder.

```bash
# Setup (run only once)
etl/scripts/setup_dev_env.sh

# Run jupyter notebook (choose the new ETL kernel)
etl/scripts/run_jupyter.sh
```

The jupyter notebook [resources/jupyter_notebooks/Analysis.ipynb](../jupyter_notebooks/Analysis.ipynb)
has an example on how to do it.
